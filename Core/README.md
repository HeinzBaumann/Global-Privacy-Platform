### About the Global Privacy Platform

The Global Privacy Platform (GPP) has the objective to enable all parties in the digital advertising chain to comply with regional privacy regulations more easily. It is a transport layer that communicates user consent and preference signaling throughout the digital supply chain that supports existing consent formats and is flexible enough to support new markets with unique needs. IAB Tech Lab stewards the development of these technical specifications.

### Value for Users

Internet users will see incremental predictability in transparency and control over time as privacy and data protection standards converge. Many more users, in countries previously uncovered by powerful digital advertising transparency and control tools, can see into and have a say over data uses for digital advertising.

### Value for Publishers, Advertisers and Ad Technology Products

Businesses will see reduced cost of maintaining privacy and data protection controls for users across the regions they work in. GPP adopters can adapt to regional changes and even gradual convergence in privacy and data protection experiences without technology switching costs.

**Guiding Principles**

- Reduce fragmented privacy signaling technologies that are costly for implementers
- Accommodate regional and country differences in privacy and data protection standards even if over time there is convergence
- Regions and countries should have support for their jurisdictions without needing to get other regions and countries to agree to adaptations
- Inclusive of existing in-use consent formats, recognizing that there have been a number of disparate efforts that need to be reflected
- The cost associated with adopting new privacy and data protection signaling technologies can be significant therefore we need to both minimizes costs and provide value with new features
- Flexibility is critical to support the needs of users, publishers, advertisers and the advertising technology products they use
