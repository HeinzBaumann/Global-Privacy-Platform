### About the Global Privacy Platform

The Global Privacy Platform (GPP) has the objective to enable all parties in the digital advertising chain to comply with regional privacy regulations more easily. It is a transport layer that communicates user consent and preference signaling throughout the digital supply chain that supports existing consent formats and is flexible enough to support new markets with unique needs. IAB Tech Lab stewards the development of these technical specifications.
